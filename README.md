## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

I created this Prework Study Guide to cover everything in the Prework for this bootcamp. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. I learned a lot about Git Flow and how important it is to get it down now so that it'll benefit me later on down the line.


## Installation

## Usage

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).
