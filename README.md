# My Prework Study Guide

## Description

I created this Prework Study Guide to cover everything in the Prework for this bootcamp. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. I learned a lot about Git Flow and how important it is to get it down now so that it'll benefit me later on down the line.
